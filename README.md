# Description (forthcoming)

Vision: To host an electronic library of Pacific salmon stressor-response functions as a “one-stop-shop” for life cycle modelers that is searchable, user-friendly, and open-source 

This e-Library will:
* store stressor-response functions for different species, life stages, and environmental stressors 
* make it easier for modelers and model users to find the most appropriate relationships for the target species and region
* increase transparency because users can examine the sources informing relationships used in models
* produce economies of scale, efficiencies, and a reduction in redundant work across different modeling teams
