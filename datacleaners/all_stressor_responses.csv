Angling may still represent a major threat to population sustainability due to incidental mortality (i.e., mortality due to stress or physical damage from hooking or handling) associated with catch and release fishing if angling effort and catchability is high (e.g., Post et al. 2003). Illegal harvest, either intentional or due to misidentification, occurs at an unknown frequency and may also contribute to population declines. Past case studies demonstrate that some Bull Trout populations are capable of recovering relatively quickly (5-10 years) from an over-exploited state under zero harvest regulations/reduced angler effort or complete angling closures (Johnston et al. 2007; Sullivan 2014).  
In the absence of information on population parameters, such as catchability and abundance, angling effort (annual rod hours per km) was used as the stressor input value. Angling effort is considered a surrogate for fishing mortality; it is assumed that there is greater mortality at high levels of effort, and lower mortality and low levels of effort.  The approximated relationship between angling effort and system capacity encompasses a linear decline in system capacity with increasing angler effort until an inflection point is reached where additional effort has no further impact on system capacity. The assumption is that there is a proportion of fish in a population that are less vulnerable or invulnerable to anglers, resulting in population resiliency albeit at lower abundance, i.e., fishing mortality alone is not expected to extirpate a population. This may occur because of reduced or variable catchability due to learned hook avoidance, heterogeneity among individual fish, and environmental factors (Askey et al. 2006, Van Poorten & Post 2011). Additionally, some fish may not be caught because anglers are unable to access all areas of a river system.  These inaccessible areas provide a similar function to marine protected areas by reducing the proportion of the total population available to fishing (Cox and Walters 2002). 
The species-specific shape of the stressor-response curve was based on a series of assumptions. First, we assumed that there was no impact to system capacity at zero angling effort (0 annual rod hours/km, 100% system capacity). Next, the x-coordinate of the inflection point was set at 18 annual rod hours/km for Bull Trout, based on Post et al. (2003) that predicted that angling effort above this value would not maintain a viable population of bull trout under catch-and-release regulations. For Westslope Cutthroat Trout this inflection point was set at 50 annual rod hours/km based on yield-per-recruit modelling that demonstrated a high potential for recruitment overfishing beyond this angling effort under catch-and-release regulations. Parameters used in this modelling exercise included a catchability coefficient of 0.015 (Sinnatamby et al. 2021) and 10% mortality due to both non-compliance and post-release mortality, similar to Post et al. (2003) (Reilly & Macpherson unpublished data).  The critical angling effort value for Bull Trout is lower than Westslope Cutthroat Trout because Bull Trout exhibit life-history characteristics that make them more vulnerable to overexploitation (e.g., slow-growing, late-maturing, high catchability) (Johnston et al. 2007).  
The y-coordinate of the inflection point was set as the 95th percentile of system capacity, calculated using all populations experiencing angling effort above the critical value. The 95th percentile was applied because it is expected that the relationship between system capacity and angling effort is better represented by the rate of change near the maximum response rather than the mean response, as system capacity is affected by multiple factors that may vary in their effect. This is similar logic to quantile regression that recognizes numerous unaccounted factors can be driving a response variable (Cade and Noon 2003). This produced inflection point coordinates of 18 annual rod hours/km and 36% system capacity for Bull Trout (Figure 1) and 50 annual rod hours/km and 38% system capacity for Westslope Cutthroat Trout. Species-specific fisheries models for Athabasca Rainbow Trout are not currently available.

Competition by Non-Native Species 
Brook Trout is a wide-spread, invasive species that may compromise populations of the three native trout species through competition (Warnock 2012, McMahon et al. 2007, Rieman et al. 2006, Peterson et al. 2008, 2004; Shepard et al. 2002, Magoulick and Wilzbach 1998; Popowich 2005; Donald 1987). If successful, Brook Trout may displace or replace, native salmonids (Behnke 1992; Peterson et al. 2004; Fausch 2007; McGrath and Lewis Jr. 2007; Peterson et al. 2008; Earle et al. 2010a, b). 
While the mechanisms of non-native Rainbow Trout invasiveness have not been fully explored, it is assumed that niche overlap with Athabasca Rainbow Trout results in the replacement, but not displacement of the native trout species. In this theoretical framework, Athabasca rainbow trout are initially lost because of another threat (e.g., overfishing), and the direct stocking or migration of stocked Rainbows results in the replacement of native fish with non-native fish. This assumed no competitive advantage from non-native fish but is simply a factor of few native fish being in the area to allow a natural recovery, in area, versus abundant, locally stocked fish.  This follows the overall theory of competition/replacement/exclusion of Volpe et al. (2000). At this time, there is no known system where native fish were abundant yet were replaced by non-native fish.
Competition only occurs when resources are limited, or the system is near carrying capacity (Dunham et al. 2002). Therefore, researchers should carefully examine available evidence to determine if Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow Trout or Lake Trout are competing with the three native trout species, or if they are taking advantage of resources made available as a result of declining native trout density due to other stressors (e.g., habitat changes, over-exploitation). Relatively high densities of Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow Trout or Lake Trout may indicate that the system is near or at carrying capacity, and therefore, competition may be occurring.  
b.	Hybridization
Currently there is an ongoing effort to understand the hybridization risk and extent of hybridization of Athabasca Rainbow Trout and non-native Rainbow Trout. Previous genetic sampling and analysis indicate that there are watersheds in the range that have only pure genetics while other watersheds contain a mix of pure and hybridized fish, this information will be refined using current genetic techniques and analysis.
The stressor-response curve to depict the impacts of competition and hybridization by non-native species on the three native trout species is a simple linear relationship between the ability of a system to hold adult native trout (system capacity) and the capacity used by Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow, Lake Trout, and hybrids (carrying capacity). Native trout system capacity and non-native/hybridized trout carrying capacity must add to 100% (Figure 1). We have not accounted for the additional adverse effects of hybridization with pure native trout. Rather, this dose-response curve only accounts for competition and replacement related to habitat, so the true negative impacts of these non-native species is likely underestimated.
","expert opinion","This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds. Due to the theoretical nature of the relationship, it could be applied to other species and geographic areas with an acknowledgement of the lack of empirical data on which the function was built. If additional data is available for other systems, those should be incorporated.","Competition by Non-Native Species 
Competition will be considered as occurring in stream reaches (order ≥2) which once held or continue to hold the three native trout species, but now contain predominately Brook Trout or non-native Rainbow Trout at densities that suggest the system is at or near carrying capacity (estimated at approximately 80 Brook Trout or non-native Rainbow Trout / 300m, but can be dependent on stream size). Stream electrofishing survey data from FWMIS identified locations with high Brook Trout and non-native Rainbow Trout densities and then expert opinion was used to estimate the stream distance upstream and downstream from this location containing high Brook Trout and non-native Rainbow Trout densities.   
Competition with Lake Trout was considered as occurring in lakes and reservoirs that once held or continue to hold Bull Trout, but now contain predominately Lake Trout at densities that suggest the system is at or near carrying capacity based on expert opinion. There are relatively few HUC10 watersheds where Lake Trout densities suggest competition may be occurring; these include the Middle Waterton River, Spray River and Abraham Lake watersheds.  
The input value was the percentage of habitat occupied by Brook Trout, non-native Rainbow Trout and Lake Trout at hypothesized carrying capacity relative to the available native trout habitat within a watershed. 

b.	Hybridization
The amount of habitat in which non-native rainbow trout are replacing Athabasca Rainbow Trout was compared to historic Athabasca Rainbow Trout habitat in each HUC10 watershed.  Replacement will be considered as occurring in streams and stream reaches (order ≥2) which once held native rainbows, but now contain non-native Rainbow Trout. Using the available genetic data, stream segments identified as near pure (Qi=0.95-0.99) or hybrid (Qi<0.95). Where genetic data was unavailable, these estimates were supplemented with local area knowledge and professional opinion. The input value was the % of stream habitat (kilometers) occupied by non-native rainbow trout relative to the kilometers of available Athabasca Rainbow Trout habitat within a HUC10.

The stressor-response curve for direct mortality (Figure 1) is based on the results from modelling using a modified version of the Bull Trout model of Post et al. (2003). Assuming a conditional mortality rate of 20% from natural causes (Post et al. 2003), a Bull Trout population shown to switch from growth overfishing to recruitment overfishing (assumed to occur at ½ of maximum system capacity) if the combined conditional rate of mortality from other sources exceeded 8% and extirpation was expected when additional mortality exceeded 12% (Figure 1). Similar to the Angling Effort (incidental angling mortality and illegal harvest) function, there is an assumption that there is a portion of fish in a population that are less vulnerable or invulnerable to direct mortality hence the system capacity does not reach zero. For all three species, the upper limit of direct mortality was not exceeded so the stressor-response curve does not have a flat-tail on the x-axis but this could be seen in the future if the threat of entrainment or research and monitoring increase. 
","Based on data for Bull Trout; Empirical data; Published/non peer-reviewed; Mechanistic theory","This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds. Parameters used to derive inflection points are specific to Bull Trout on the Alberta east slopes, so it should be applied to other species with caution. ","a.	Entrainment Mortality 
Fish can become entrained in irrigation canal headworks and killed if not rescued before the canal is dewatered at the end of the irrigation season. Entrainment rates are expected to be variable between canals, however, there have been no recent studies to determine the total number of entrained fish and the overall effect on population sustainability. The primary data source to inform the potential severity of this threat is the Trout Unlimited Canada annual fish rescue program, which includes most but not all canal headworks within the current Bull Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout range. Typically, no or small numbers of entrained Bull Trout (<10) and Westslope Cutthroat Trout (<5) are rescued (Lindsey et al. 2015); however, it should be noted that the rescues are not designed to estimate entrainment rates so these numbers should be viewed as minimum values only. In contrast, entrainment at the Belly River canal prior to screening to exclude large fish was estimated at 15 – 20% of annual mortality (Clayton 2001). The majority of canal headworks within Alberta's eastern slopes do not have fish exclusion devices.
Fish can also become entrained in powerhouses for hydroelectric reservoirs where a portion are killed as they pass through the turbines. Various aspects of Bull Trout entrainment in hydroelectric reservoirs have been widely studied in both the U.S. and British Columbia (B.C.) (Martins et al. 2013, Ma et al. 2012, Underwood and Kramer 2007, Salow and Hostettler 2004, and FERC 1995).  Entrainment and mortality rates are highly site-specific, varying with physical factors including reservoir size, dam height, fore bay configuration, depth of intake, turbine type, and operational timing as well as biological factors including fish size, seasonal and diurnal movements and density-dependent influences on fish movement.  While few generalizations can be made, entrainment rates of adult, sub-adult or juvenile Bull Trout can and do impact populations typically as annual losses (i.e., direct morality and permanent loss to downstream reaches) of <5%. For example: 1) Kinbasket Reservoir, B.C., adult Bull Trout - 3.4% loss (Martins et al. 2013); 2) Arrowrock Reservoir, ID, adult Bull Trout - 4% loss, 11% loss when drawn down for maintenance (Salow and Hostettler 2004), and 3) Rimrock Reservoir, WA, sub-adult Bull Trout - 1.4% loss (Underwood and Cramer 2007). Substantially greater mortality rates (9 – 42%, size dependent) are anticipated for the Peace/Halfway River Bull Trout population during the operation of the Site C Dam in B.C. (Ma et al. 2012). Higher entrainment rates have been recorded at the hydropower operation at the Aberfeldie Dam in British Columbia (Langford 2016). 
For the Joe model, watersheds containing irrigation canal headworks were assigned an entrainment conditional mortality rate of 1% and those containing hydroelectric dams were assigned a rate of 4%, unless other data were available.

b.	Research and Monitoring
Standard scientific methods for monitoring native trout populations typically involve the non-lethal capture, handling, and release of individual fish.  Methods used to capture native trout include electrofishing, angling, trapping, and netting, with backpack and boat electrofishing being the most widely used in Alberta. After capture, fish are held for processing, often anesthetized, and measured. Depending on the project objectives, fish may also be marked (tagged), surgically implanted with telemetry transmitters, and/or have a small portion of a fin removed for genetic analysis. Lethal sampling of native trout is uncommon but may occur if information that cannot be collected using non-lethal means (e.g., maturity and age data) is required for management and assessment purposes. In these cases, the potential impacts on population sustainability are thoroughly reviewed by the appropriate regulatory agency(s) prior to project approval. 
Alberta Fisheries Management has developed a series of standards including the Standard for the Ethical Use of Fish in Alberta (AESRD 2013a), Standard for Sampling Small Streams in Alberta (AESRD 2013b) and Electrofishing Policy Respecting Injuries to Fish (AFMD 2004) to minimize fish injury, stress and mortality during non-lethal collection and handling by research crews. These standards are included as conditions on Research Licences, which are mandatory licences issued to all agencies and organizations conducting fisheries-related work in the province. Research Licences also include a section detailing Best Management Practices relating to the processing of fish in cold and hot weather, proper handling techniques, and the use of anaesthetic. While the application of standards and best management practices does minimize fish injury, stress and mortality, some incidental mortality during fish collection and handling may occur. Incidental mortality is assumed to have negligible to very low population-level effects because the majority of native trout surveys are limited to small representative areas of a watershed and project time periods are typically short (1-5 years). Therefore, mortality due to scientific research and monitoring will not be included in the total annual mortality calculation unless there is evidence of a population-level impact within a particular watershed. Similarly, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service analyzed the effects of scientific research through a biological opinion survey (USFWS 2000) and determined that scientific collection does not jeopardize Bull Trout populations and is therefore not identified as a threat factor in the U.S. Bull Trout recovery plan (USFWS 2015). Nonetheless, this parameter is included in the model and the level of research and monitoring mortality is included in the calculations.
For the Joe model the conditional rate of mortality due to research and monitoring was set to 0% unless other data were available. Values will be adjusted if new information becomes available suggesting otherwise.

An Athabasca Rainbow Trout or Westslope Cutthroat Trout population may be at high risk of extirpation if the combined conditional rate of mortality from other sources exceeds 15% (Figure 1).

No large-scale hydroelectric projects are currently in operation within the natural range of Athabasca Rainbow Trout. However, plans for hydroelectric and diversion dams are commonly proposed, such as proposals for dams on the Athabasca River and major tributaries (Hatch 2010).      
For the Joe model, watersheds containing irrigation canal headworks were assigned an entrainment conditional mortality rate of 1% and those containing hydroelectric dams were assigned a rate of 4%, unless other data were available.

The shape of the curve and threshold value (5.1 mg/L) is based on segmented regression of specific growth rate as a function of dissolved oxygen averaged across 30 species. The inference implicit in using growth as the response variable is that threshold effects of low DO on individual growth will be similar to population-level effects. Although the average segmented regression across all species is highly significant and the threshold or 5.1 mg/L is consistent with previous analyses and regulatory guidelines for water quality, it should be noted that there remains great inter-specific variation around the mean response.  Some species are relatively insensitive to hypoxia, particularly warmwater species, and others (particularly coolwater species and salmonids) showing higher sensitivity (see Fig. 1 below from Rosenfeld and Lee 2022).  

We initially assumed that Nooksack dace would be relatively sensitive to low oxygen, as they are a riffle-dwelling species that occupy turbulent and well-oxygenated habitat.  Consequently, our initial inference was to assign then the same sensitivity to reduced oxygen as salmonids, which have a relatively steeper decline in growth with reduced DO than the average for all species (Rosenfeld and Lee 2022, see Fig. 1b below).  However, during sampling for fish in Aug. 2024 we made an observation which suggests that they are not as sensitive as salmonids.  During a fish salvage in Pepin Creek, we placed 2 Nooksack dace in a 4l bucket along with one juvenile coho and 3 juvenile cutthroat trout (young-of-the-year).  It was a warm day, and we inadvertently forgot about the bucket which was placed on the stream bank.  When we checked up on it after an hour, the three yoy trout had asphyxiated, but the coho and the 2 dace were fine, and showed no sign of harm when held in the creek in a flow-through bin before release.  This indicates that Nooksack dace are likely more tolerant of hypoxia than trout, despite being adapted to fast-water habitat, and we therefore used the average growth reduction vs. dissolved oxygen regression in Rosenfeld and Lee (2022; see their Fig. 1a below) as the stressor-response function for dissolved oxygen.

Although the average segmented regression across all species is highly significant and the threshold or 5.1 mg/L is consistent with previous analyses and regulatory guidelines for water quality, there remains great inter-specific variation around the mean response.  Salish sucker is not a cold-water species and therefore, less sensitive to hypoxia compared to salmonids (Rosenfeld et al. 2021; Zinn et al. 2021).  Based on observation and experience, and the assumption that Salish sucker are selected for some degree of hypoxia tolerance because they have evolved in small streams subject to seasonal drying and low flows (and also prefer deep pool or wetland habitat that is subject to intermittent hypoxia), the threshold DO for sublethal effects on Salish sucker has been set at 4 mg/L (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2019).  We set the x-intercept at 0.5 mg/L to reflect the higher known tolerance of Salish sucker compared to salmonids (x-intercept ≈ 3 mg/L) and the average across all species (0.8 mg/l DO; Rosenfeld et al. 2021, Rosenfeld and Lee 2022).  The habitat suitability index model for Longnose Sucker (Edwards, 1983) generally supports the shape of the function, but has a higher threshold (6 mg/L) and x-intercept (4.5 mg/L), reflecting the fact that Longnose sucker (the sister-species to Salish sucker) are a cool-water species.

Plains Sucker can persist in relatively high flow (e.g. Milk River during summer augmentation) and low flow environments (e.g. pools with little to no flow). It is expected that the full stressor-response function for flow will be unimodal in shape, where extremely high flow rates will likely negatively impact Plains Sucker. For example, failure velocity experiments on Plains Sucker showed that fish failed to hold their position at flow rates ranging from 0.08-1.05 m•s-1 (MacLeod 2023); however, Plains Sucker have been found in rivers with mean summer or autumn flow rates that range from 0.3-16.1 m3•s-1. In terms of field data, we have biomass (catch-per-unit-effort; CPUE) data for 6 sites within the Milk River drainage, along with water velocities for the site on sampling day (Teillet et al. 2021). If MAD is calculated using the mean of these values (n=6, MAD=0.14 m/s) and % system capacity is scaled such that 100% system capacity is the highest biomass estimate from these data, then % system capacity peaks at ~132% MAD. Without more reliable data on biomass or abundance, MAD, the energy expenditure of swimming or maintaining position under various flow conditions, or the full range of stream flow experienced by Plains Sucker we cannot estimate an upper threshold at this time.","Expert opinion","This stressor-response function is suitable for use on Plains Sucker populations in the Saskatchewan-Nelson and Missouri River drainages in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan; however, it should be noted that preliminary analyses of experimental data suggest that there may be differences in physiological tolerances to flow between the Milk River populations and other waterbodies because Milk River populations are subject to increased flows annually from April-October and may have adapted accordingly (MacLeod 2023). It may be reasonable to assume the SR function can be applied to Cordilleran Sucker, given the similarity of their physical characteristics (prior to 2023 both species were classified under a single species, Mountain Sucker); however, there is no data to confirm this assumption. It should also be noted that experimental data suggest that Plains Sucker could hold their position at higher flow rates than White Sucker and Longnose Sucker (two other catostomids in the Missouri River drainage; MacLeod 2023); however, only one study was conducted and energetic costs were not considered. Therefore, more data are required and caution should be taken when using this function on other species.","MacLeod (2023) reported mean flow rates for the Milk River (mean augmented flow rate [April-September]: 16.06 m3⋅s-1; mean natural flow rate [October-March]: 2.36 m3⋅s-1) and Battle Creek (mean summer flow rate [April-September]: 0.46 m3⋅s-1 ; mean winter flow rate [October, February, and March]: 0.31 m3⋅s-1).

For instance, increased discharge during spring runoff and additional peak flow events throughout the year may result in downstream displacement of emerging fry (Ottaway and Clarke 1981) and have negative effects on spring-spawning species that may be prey for trout (e.g., Seegrist and Gard 1972). Further, Jensen and Johnsen (1999) observed a negative correlation between year-class strength of two fall spawning salmonids and size of peak flood during the spring. There is also evidence that increased frequency of peak flow events can result in short- and long-term changes to river morphology that would impact trout, such as a reduction of habitat complexity and quantity of pool habitat (Lyons and Beschta 1983; Everest et al. 1985; Bonneau and Scarnecchia 1998) and the formation of an “oversized” channel. The potential for hydrologic change in watersheds was considered negligible when < 20% of the watershed was disturbed land (i.e., human footprint), low to moderate when 20–50% of the watershed was disturbed, and high when >50% of the watershed was disturbed (Figure 1). These thresholds are similar to Equivalent Clear-cut Area hazard categories recommended by Alberta Forestry and Agriculture (Stednick 1996; Guillemette et al. 2005; Mike Wagner pers. comm.). In the absences of other impacts, it was assumed that trout populations are resilient to a low degree of change and could persist, albeit at very low density, in watersheds where hydrologic change is high (Figure 1).","expert judgement","This function was applied to the three species for which it was developed (Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout).

However, one of the most serious concerns for fish species is the fragmentation of connected riverine habitats, as dams that are not equipped with fish passage facilities can act as complete barriers to upstream and downstream fish movements (Marmulla 2001; GOA 2023, The Alberta Westslope Cutthroat Trout Recovery Team 2013). Many fish populations are likely sustained by metapopulation dynamics, where immigration from source populations ensures the persistence of surrounding subpopulations (Hanski 1998; Dunham and Rieman 1999). As a result, severing lotic connections may limit dispersal, and inhibit the recolonization of small, isolated populations that can be at increased risk of extinction through demographic, environmental and genetic stochasticity (Lande 1998; Morita et al. 2009). While literature has explored fragmentation of sturgeon habitat (Jager et al. 2001), fewer studies have evaluated the effects of dams on stream-dwelling salmonids. Of the available literature, Morita and Yokota (2002) found that extinction risk of White-Spotted Charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) increased in small and isolated habitat fragments (Morita and Yamamoto 2002; Letcher et al. 2007). For cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii), Harig and Fausch (2002) noted that population success upstream of barriers was strongly linked to available habitat area. Letcher et al. (2007) simulated fragmentation scenarios in a stream-resident Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) metapopulation and found that extinction was likely unless immigration from above barriers was possible or fish exhibited demographic life history changes. 

In Alberta, it is difficult to quantify the effects of fragmentation due to large dams on the native trout species. The overall population level effect depends on a variety of factors such as patch size, habitat quality, and population size (Morita et al. 2009), as well as life history and behavioural traits (Letcher et al. 2007, Morita et al. 2009) and meta-population dynamics, and in most cases this information is not available for fish populations in the province. It is possible however, to provide a relative, qualitative estimate based on professional opinion considering available datasets. Several hypothetical situations will be described to elucidate this process. In the simplest case, if there are no dams in the system, then there is no effect.  If a dam inhibits movement of migratory Bull Trout into a small portion of the lower watershed they once occasionally frequented (based on telemetry data), a low or very low effect size may be assigned. In contrast, a moderate effect would be assigned if the dam resulted in an isolated, trout population existing in a relatively small habitat patch, with no possible connections to other trout populations. Lastly, the severe decline or functional extirpation of migratory trout downstream of a dam soon after construction may indicate that suitable habitat to support all life history needs is no longer available (high to very high effect size). Until further information is available, the relationship between barrier dam effect size and sustainability of trout populations is assumed to be linear (Figure 1).

Improperly installed road crossings can cause immediate and long-term effects on fish populations by altering habitat characteristics, fragmenting fish habitat and impeding fish movements necessary to complete life history processes (Warren and Pardew 1998; Gunn and Sein 2000; Harper and Quigley 2000; Morita and Yamamoto 2002; Park et al. 2008; Burford et al. 2009; MacPherson et al. 2012).
In the absence of a provincial road crossing status dataset, the assumption was that relatively high numbers of road crossings indicate a greater risk of habitat fragmentation. Audits of crossing structures in several northwestern Alberta watersheds reported that approximately half of assessed culverts were considered potential barriers to fish passage (Scrimgeour et al. 2003; Johns and Ernst 2007; Park et al. 2008). There is a paucity of studies directly measuring population-level impacts of fragmentation on trout species specifically, although road density has been positively associated with reduced occupancy of the species (Ripley et al. 2005) and is correlated with road crossing densities within watersheds in the Alberta Bull Trout range (R2=0.59, J. Reilly, pers. comm.). The hypothetical relationship between road crossing density and trout system capacity was determined following the risk threshold approach outlined in MacPherson et al. (2012) using the highest estimated road crossing density to indicate the greatest degree of extirpation risk (Figure 1). Although the stressor response curves look very similar for Bull Trout/Athabasca Rainbow Trout and for Westslope Cutthroat Trout, there are slight differences in the relationship between fragmentation values and system capacity.

","Number of road and stream intersections per watershed were estimated using the provincial road spatial layer, excluding winter roads and ferry crossings. For Bull Trout, only Strahler order 3-5 streams were considered because bull trout occur infrequently in Order 1 and 2 streams; for Athabasca Rainbow Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout and only order 2 and 3 streams were considered because they occur infrequently in Order 1 streams. In Alberta foothills, watercourse crossing datasets have shown that culverts occur infrequently on-stream orders 5 and greater, however, local experts suggested that given smaller stream size and road condition, that culverts could occur on larger stream orders in these watersheds.

""Jager (2011) reviewed and compiled mortality and exposure duration data from constanttemperature laboratory studies for Chinook salmon eggs (fertilization to hatching) and alevins(hatching to emergence). For each study, Jager (2011) standardized the survival data by dividingby the maximum survival over all temperature treatments for each study. If the study did not reportthe duration of the two lifestages, a temperature relationship was fitted to the lifestage to estimateduration.

Studies incorporated for the fertilized egg relationship included Murray and McPhail (1988),Combs and Burrows (1957), Garling and Masterson (1985), Beacham and Murray (1989), Jensenand Groot (1991), and Heming (1982). Due to lack of duration data, exposure durations wereestimated for fertilized eggs for the Combs and Burrows (1957) data. Studies used in the alevinrelationship included Murray and McPhail (1988), Garling and Masterson (1985), Beacham andMurray (1989), and Jensen and Groot (1991). Due to a reported lack of lifestage duration data,durations were estimated for alevins for the Garling and Masterson (1985) and Jensen and Groot(1991) data. For studies where replicate treatments were conducted, survival rates from thereplicates were averaged (using a weighted average based on starting number of eggs or alevin)together for each water temperature treatment.

Based on these data, Jager (2011) developed a model relating daily survival of Chinook salmonfertilized eggs and alevins to water temperature using a double Weibull model (Figure 6). Theright-hand side of the function for eggs (i.e., at 0% daily survival) is driven by two data pointsfrom Jensen and Groot (1991). These two data points were excluded from the Water Forumfertilized egg function development (this TM) because mortality reached 100% prior to 50% hatch,and duration to mortality was not reported. In addition, although mortality reached 100% prior to50% hatch, it is unlikely that the daily survival rate was actually 0%, particularly for the 64.4°Ftreatment. Although the equation to calculate daily survival based on cumulative survival andduration will result in a 0% daily survival rate, results from other laboratory studies (Seymour1956 and USFWS 1999) that exposed fertilized eggs to water temperatures of 64-64.6°F indicate that daily mortality rates ranged from 2.8% to 15%. In addition, short-term thermal exposure (“heat shock”) experiments found that mortality rates of Chinook salmon cleavage egg and embryo lifestages exposed to 22°C (71.6°F) for 8 hours were 10% and 3%, respectively (Neitzel and Becker 1985).

Similar to the fertilized egg function, the right-hand side of the pre-emergent fry (“alevin”)function is driven by only one data point, also from Jensen and Groot (1991), for the 61.5°Ftreatment. This data point also was excluded from the Water Forum alevin function (this TM) dueto concern over the inconsistency in the duration from 50% hatch to emergence for this temperaturetreatment relative to other treatments. Although Jager (2011) calculated the exposure durationbased on water temperature, it is unlikely that, despite the cumulative survival of 0%, that the dailysurvival rate was 0% (i.e., all alevins perished in one day) at 61.5°F, in consideration of the otherwater temperature studies.

""Jager (2011) reviewed and compiled mortality and exposure duration data from constanttemperature laboratory studies for Chinook salmon eggs (fertilization to hatching) and alevins(hatching to emergence). For each study, Jager (2011) standardized the survival data by dividingby the maximum survival over all temperature treatments for each study. If the study did not reportthe duration of the two lifestages, a temperature relationship was fitted to the lifestage to estimateduration.

Fine sediment data came from a combination of field surveys and estimates from empirical models. Empirical model estimated reach-averaged fine sediment as a function of road density (fine sed = 5.74 + 2.05 * road density, where road density is the surface area coverage of the drainage area, ha roads/ha watershed). This function is unlikely to be transferable to other systems..

Sediment to incubation productivity is derived from source data in Jensen et al. 2009. Synthetic function for sediment is intended to be generalized for all pacific salmon.

Underlying formula is Incubation Productivity = 1 / (1 + e^-(B0 + B1*sed)), where B0 is 1.989 and B1 is -0.185.

Low-level inputs of phosphorus during oligotrophic stream fertilization projects in B.C. have resulted in increased fish size and abundance due to substantial increases in trophic productivity with limited impact to water quality (Koning et al. 1998). However, higher levels of nutrient inputs lead to stream eutrophication and degraded water quality, including reduced nocturnal dissolved oxygen in summer (Chung 2013; Jacobsen and Marin 2008) and overall anoxic conditions that can impair biodiversity (Meijering 1991). For example, degraded stream habitats and fish winterkill conditions in Alberta foothills were correlated with theoretical increases in phosphorus runoff due to land use at the watershed scale (Norris 2012). 
The phosphorus stressor-response curve was developed using potential phosphorous loading estimates and current FSA risk categories for the three native trout species trout (see MacPherson et al. 2019; AEP 2013). FSA risk categories vary from 0 (functionally extirpated) to 5 (very low risk). The potential phosphorous loading estimate for each watershed was obtained using ALCES© online. Phosphorus runoff was measured as a potential loading value for each watershed (tonnes/ha/year). 
The stressor-response curve was derived by: a) using logistic regression to develop a statistical model relating probability of being within a given FSA category to the log-transformed phosphorous loading estimate; and, b) converting this statistical model into a stressor-response curve relating phosphorus to a percent reduction native trout system capacity from a pristine reference condition.  Proportional-odds logistic regression was used since the response variable is a multinomial ordered variable (Venables and Ripley 2002).  The proportional-odds assumption of independence among adjacent categories was assessed by comparing similarity of odds ratios among successive categories (Venables and Ripley 2002). 
The stressor-response curve was derived from the proportional-odds logistic-regression models by estimating phosphorous loading estimates required for a 90% probability of falling within a given FSA category.  This is similar logic to quantile regression (Cade and Noon 2003) that recognizes numerous unaccounted factors can be driving a response variable.  FSA categories were converted to percent of reference condition using population percentages at transition points between adjacent FSA categories.  
The FSA risk category for trout was rarely 3 or better when phosphorus loading potential was ≥0.1 tonnes/ha/year. No watersheds with a FSA risk category of 5 were observed.  There was a significant phosphorus level effect (slope = -0.42, 95% profile confidence interval -0.65 to -0.21) with the probability of a watershed being within a lower FSA category increasing with phosphorus loading. From these probability distributions, the stressor-response for system capacity for the 3 native trout species at a given phosphorus loading estimate was developed (Figure 1).
A major issue in assessing the importance of potential stressors in driving a response variable is collinearity amongst different stressors (Zuur et al. 2010).  If different stressors are highly correlated, it is impossible to distinguish relative importance without further experimentation.  There was a high degree of correlation between potential phosphorus loading (tonnes/ha/year) and the relative sediment increase across the 73 watersheds (Pearson R = 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.45 – 0.74).  Thus, it was difficult using the available data to separate the importance of phosphorus or sediment independently on system capacity.  Our approach was to create two separate stressor-response curves (i.e., one for potential phosphorus loading independent of the sediment index and vice-versa) and acknowledge that the observed response could be driven by the other stressor.  As the Joe model accumulates cumulative effects multiplicatively (additive on a proportional scale), treating these two curves separately would inappropriately overemphasize the expected response. To overcome this issue, we treated sediment and phosphorus in the Joe model using a limiting factor approach.  Simply, only the strongest, negative response from either the phosphorus or sediment stressor-response curves is used to calculate final system capacity.  Anytime a watershed shows either phosphorus or sediment to be a hypothesized key driver, it must be acknowledged that the other stressor (i.e., sediment or phosphorus, respectively) could be the driver given the collinearity.

The breakdown product of the rubber tire antioxidant N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD)-6-PPD-quinone has been strongly implicated in toxic injury and death in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in urban waterways. Less information is known about Chinook Salmon.

Lo et al (2023) investigated the acute toxicity of 6PPD-Q to newly feeding (~3 weeks post swim-up) juvenile Chinook and coho over a 24-h exposure. Mortality-based concentration–response curves were established, and a comparison of species sensitivity was explored. Bonnie et al (2023) results could be used to inform the risk of this prevalent urban contaminant to juvenile Chinook and coho and to aid in the conservation, recovery, and management efforts.

Figure 1 Caption: Concentration–response curves for 24-h juvenile (A) coho salmon and (B) Chinook salmon exposures to 6PPD-quinone. Results confirmed that juvenile Chinook are far less sensitive to 6PPD-quinone than coho. Measured concentrations at test initiation were used to calculate the dose–response curve. The median lethal concentration (LC50) was calculated using a log-logistic model.

The breakdown product of the rubber tire antioxidant N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine-quinone (6PPD)-6-PPD-quinone has been strongly implicated in toxic injury and death in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in urban waterways. Less information is known about Chinook Salmon.

Lo et al (2023) investigated the acute toxicity of 6PPD-Q to newly feeding (~3 weeks post swim-up) juvenile Chinook and coho over a 24-h exposure. Mortality-based concentration–response curves were established, and a comparison of species sensitivity was explored. Bonnie et al (2023) results could be used to inform the risk of this prevalent urban contaminant to juvenile Chinook and coho and to aid in the conservation, recovery, and management efforts.

Results confirmed that juvenile Chinook are far less sensitive to 6PPD-quinone than coho. Measured concentrations at test initiation were used to calculate the dose–response curve. The median lethal concentration (LC50) was calculated using a log-logistic model.

The amount of sediment a stream can transport is based on numerous factors including, but not limited to, precipitation, surface water transport, erosion, topography, geology and riparian vegetation (reviewed in Muck 2010). Anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., such as roads, Lachance et al. 2008) can produce substantial inputs of sediments into streams in excess of natural levels. These increased rates of sediment delivery can adversely affect bull trout habitat and have lethal and sub-lethal effects throughout trout life history from egg incubation to adulthood (reviewed in Muck 2010). 
Potential impacts caused by excessive suspended sediments are varied, complex and often masked by other concurrent activities (Newcombe 2003), making it difficult to establish the specific effects of sediment impacts on fish (Chapman 1988). The sediment stressor-response curve was developed using sediment estimates obtained from ALCES online based on 2010 footprint and current FSA risk categories for the native trout species (see MacPherson et al. 2019; AEP 2013, 2018, 2019) in the HUC 8 watersheds across Alberta’s East Slopes. FSA risk categories vary from 0 (functionally extirpated) to 5 (very low risk). The dynamic pattern of sediment transport varies from watershed to watershed and aquatic ecosystems have adapted to the natural temporal and spatial pattern of this transport. As such, effects on fish from changes in sediment loading will be relative to natural conditions (Kemp et al. 2011). To capture relative change, sediment in the stressor-response curve was defined as the “sediment index” which is measured as potential sediment loading for 2010 (tonnes/ha/year) divided by potential sediment loading for 1910 (tonnes/ha/year). 
The sediment index (2010 loading/1910 loading) stressor-response curves were derived by: a) using logistic regression to develop a statistical model relating probability of being within a given FSA category to the log-transformed sediment index; and, b) converting this statistical model into a stressor-response curve relating sediment to the system capacity of the 3 trout species.  Proportional-odds logistic regression was used as the response variable is a multinomial ordered variable (Venables and Ripley 2002).  The proportional-odds assumption of independence among adjacent categories was assessed by comparing similarity of odds ratios among successive categories (Venables and Ripley 2002). 
The stressor-response curve was derived from the proportional-odds logistic-regression models by estimating sediment index levels required for a 90% probability of falling within a given FSA category.  This is similar logic to quantile regression (Cade and Noon 2003) that recognizes numerous unaccounted factors can be driving a response variable.  FSA categories were converted to percent of reference condition using population percentages at transition points between adjacent FSA categories.  
Compared to phosphorus, the data showed a much clearer separation among FSA categories with increasing sediment relative to background 1910 values. An adult FSA category of 4 existed in watersheds when relative sediment increases were negligible. FSA categories of 1 or 0 dominated when sediment increased more than 3-fold over background levels.  Not surprisingly, there was a significant and strong negative sediment effect on association with FSA categories (slope = -2.8, 95% profile confidence interval –3.8 to -2.0). The stressor-response curve is shown in Figure 1.
A major issue in assessing the importance of potential stressors in driving a response variable is collinearity amongst different stressors (Zuur et al. 2010).  If different stressors are highly correlated, it is impossible to distinguish relative importance without further experimentation.  There was a high degree of correlation between potential phosphorus loading (tonnes/ha/year) and the relative sediment increase across the 73 watersheds (Pearson R = 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.45 – 0.74).  Thus, it was difficult using the available data to separate the importance of phosphorus or sediment independently on system capacity.  Our approach was to create two separate stressor-response curves (i.e., one for potential phosphorus loading independent of the sediment index and vice-versa) and acknowledge that the observed response could be driven by the other stressor.  As the Joe model accumulates cumulative effects multiplicatively (additive on a proportional scale), treating these two curves separately would inappropriately overemphasize the expected response. To overcome this issue, we treated sediment and phosphorus in the Joe model using a limiting factor approach.  Simply, only the strongest, negative response from either the phosphorus or sediment stressor-response curves is used to calculate final system capacity.  Anytime a watershed shows either phosphorus or sediment to be a hypothesized key driver, it must be acknowledged that the other stressor (i.e., sediment or phosphorus, respectively) could be the driver given the collinearity.

A variety of natural and human causes can lead to increases in selenium in fish, including open-pit mining that exposes limestone, increases in sedimentation and run-off, and atmospheric deposition from coal-burning power plants (Barceloux 1999; Lemly 2004). In salmonid fish, observed individual-level effects of selenium toxicity include a decrease in egg incubation time, hatch rate, fry survival, juvenile survival, and juvenile growth (e.g. Hodson et al. 1980, Hamilton et al. 1986, Hamilton et al. 1990). High concentrations of selenium have been detected in east slopes streams in the range of Athabasca Rainbow Trout, apparently caused by open-pit coal mining (Palace et al. 2004). Extensive reviews of selenium in Alberta fishes and waters are found in Fortin (2010) and Pilgrim (2012). 

At a population level, decreased juvenile survival could result in decreased population size. However, to date most studies have focused on individual-level effects, but results have rarely been extrapolated to the population. The selenium stressor-response curves for Athabasca rainbow trout were derived based on the research of Pilgrim (2012). Units of selenium concentration that best described population-level effects on Rainbow Trout were egg Se (microgram/gram wet-weight) (Figure 1).

Although the ecotoxicology of elevated selenium levels in warm and cold-water fish has been studied by numerous authors, the effects of selenium contamination remain somewhat controversial (Kennedy et al. 2000, Sappington 2002, Hardy et al. 2010). Therefore, as new population-level literature becomes available, the dose-response curve should be updated.

The thermal characteristics of Bull Trout habitat in Alberta were explored by comparing mean warmest month temperature (MWMT) derived using the program Climate WNA© (Hamann and Wang 2005; Wang et al. 2006) to all locations where Bull Trout have been captured between 1946–2013 (FWMIS query, Nov. 2013). Air temperature was used in this analysis because there is currently no province-wide water temperature dataset or model available. Of note, updated spatial stream network (SSN) temperature models are currently in development, but were not yet complete for use in this version of the Joe model. We expect that refinements to the stream temperature model stressor-response curves and watershed input values will occur once these models are complete. In addition, air and water temperatures are typically correlated over time scales >1 week (Mohseni et al. 1998). The minimum and maximum air temperature thresholds (10°C and 17°C; Figure 1) were similar to those reported in previous laboratory and field studies investigating the effects of water temperature on Bull Trout growth and survival (Selong et al. 2001) and occupancy (Dunham et al. 2003; Wenger et al. 2011). The findings of this analysis were used to inform the shape of the stressor-response curve below, which characterizes the expected influence of warm temperatures on the system capacity of Bull Trout populations (Figure 1).
The rapid decline in the number of occurrences of the three trout species on the colder ranges, between 10°C to 13°C for Bull Trout, 6°C to 8°C for Athabasca Rainbow Trout and 8°C to 13°C for Westslope Cutthroat Trout is likely due to sampling bias (i.e., there are fewer sampling events in cold, high-elevation areas that are difficult to access). However, in visually inspecting stream temperatures in colonized Jasper National Park streams with excellent Athabasca Rainbow Trout populations they fall within the modelled 5-8°C temperature range. Therefore, lotic habitats with these colder temperatures were still considered to be excellent Athabasca Rainbow Trout habitat and while cold temperatures undoubtedly can limit Bull Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout distributions, for the first iteration of this dose-response curve the results were not extended to the cold side of the curve due to lower confidence in this portion of the analysis.","Empirical data; Correlative model; Landscape correlation; Published/peer-reviewed","This function was developed and applied to Bull Trout in Alberta foothills watersheds.

""We employed the empirical relationship reported by Tagart (1984) for the effects of percent
fine sediment (<0.85 mm) on survival to emergence for coho (Figure 5). We assumed the
same relationship is applicable to chinook salmon and steelhead trout. Using a benchmark
survival to emergence of 60% (assumed average survival under optimal conditions for
chinook and coho), we can convert Tagart's survivals into sensitivity (as 1 minus survival
divided by the benchmark) and plot the values against the appropriate Level 2 rating values
on the x-axis (Figure 6). The resulting relationship forms the rule for sediment effects on the
incubation life stage, except when the hydrologic regime is mainly characterized as
groundwater fed.7 In that case, upwelling associated with groundwater sources appears to
largely protect embryos from deleterious effects of high fines (Bjornn and Reiser 1991,
Waters 1995). This explains why salmonids can have high rates of reproduction in some
streams despite excessive deposits of fine sediment (e.g., chum and sockeye salmon are
known to spawn heavily in groundwater fed streams, even in areas of excessive fines). We
therefore created a Rule Category for this hydrologic regime that maintained high survivals
even at high levels of fine sediment""

(1983) for Longnose dace temperature suitability, and Pearson (2004) and Gray and Rosenfeld (2024) for Nooksack dace CPUE and yoy growth, respectively. In addition, we considered the expert opinion provided at the workshop conducted in November 2024.  Maximum system capacity was defined by the highest value for both the habitat suitability index, CPUE (fish trap-1), and fish growth, all of which were normalized to a maximum of 1 (or 100%). The overall curve (shape and threshold values) is based on the habitat suitability curve proposed by Edwards (1983) for Longnose Dace. However, the upper threshold and upper and lower y-intercepts (temperatures where system capacity is equal to zero) were modified based on existing Nooksack dace data and expert opinion.  The upper threshold was first set at set at 19°C based on Edwards (1983) and then shifted to 20°C based on expert opinion (Mike Pearson, Pers. Comm., 2024) derived during a Nov. 12th 2024 expert elicitation workshop. The lower intercept value of 10°C was set based on data from Pearson (2004) for the relationship between temperature and CPUE (10°C was the lowest temperature where fish were caught in traps). The upper intercept was originally set at 23°C was based on the highest temperature where Nooksack dace were caught in traps and then shifted to 24°C based on expert opinion (Mike Pearson, Pers. Comm., 2024).   Because larval dace growth experiments reported in Gray and Rosenfeld (2024) indicate higher optimal temperatures than those based on activity (CPUE) of adults, a larval/yoy dace curve was also generated with a conservatively 2C higher upper bound, assuming that individual growth effects in enclosures will be equivalent to population-level effects.   Note that for general use the adult curves are most appropriate, because they are the more thermally sensitive life stage. 

 

Maximum temperature tolerance 

It should also be noted that there is anecdotal correlative evidence that Nooksack Dace are potentially more tolerant of higher temperatures (at least for short time periods) than indicated by the upper limit of our SR function.  During the heat dome event of June 25- July 31, 2021, temperatures in Bertrand Creek were significantly higher than the maximum 24C that we identify as zero capacity in the temperature SR function (see flow gauge data screen shot below).  The temperature sensor in the USGS Bertand Creek flow gauge at 0 Avenue on the international border recorded a high of 25.6 C on June 28th, and the accuracy of the temperature sensor is confirmed by a DO/temperature logger that was placed approximately 50 m upstream on June 30th and recorded approximately the same maximum daily temperature as the sensor at the flow gauge (data from Samantha Ramirez M.Sc. thesis; 23.3 C for USGS gauge, 23.0 C for the DO logger placed ~ 10-20cm below the surface in an unstratified glide habitat). 

 

Although this data suggests that dace were exposed to temperatures in excess of 24C during this period, it should be noted that this exposure was of comparatively short duration - less than 12 hours on each consecutive day (see horizontal red lines in the figure below).  Although groundwater inputs in lower Bertrand Creek are likely minor, it is also unclwear to what extent dace may have avoided higher temperatures by seeking out deeper water or other refuges. The impact of these thermal exposures on dace are also unclear, in terms of both potential lethal and sublethal effects.  We observed dead juvenile coho and cutthroat trout in Bertrand over this time period, likely as a consequence of low dissolved oxygen and elevated temperatures.  These fish were either floating or visible on the bed of the stream or stream margins.  However, Nooksack dace do not have swim bladders and generally hide in substrate interstices, so that mortalities would have been unlikely to have been noticed.  We did observe some unusual adult dace activity, which included observations of adults swimming during the day (adults are primarily crepuscular or nocturnal), and adult dace swimming in mixed schools of juvenile salmonids, apparently drift feeding or perhaps exploiting higher velocities to maximize oxygen exchange at the gill-water interface. However, this unusual swimming of adults in mixed schools of salmonids, although atypical, has been observed during extreme low-flow conditions when temperatures are warm in years before the Heat Dome event (Jordan Rosenfeld, pers. Obs.), and may also represent a density-dependent switch to drift feeding when benthic abundance becomes depleted.  Larval (young-of-year) Nooksack dace behaviour and habitat use did not appear to be affected by the high temperatures during the heat dome based on behavioural observations and larval dace counts that were taking place during the Heat Dome event.  In terms of potential population level effects, fish abundance estimates from electrofishing in Bertrand Creek riffles in Aug. 2021 (roughly 2 months after the Heat Dome) did not indicate densities of fish that were unexpectedly low, although the absence of 2020 baseline density estimates prevents a precise comparison.  All in all, while the Heat Dome event does suggest some scope for tolerance of temperatures in excess of 24C for durations of up to half a day, the consequences of longer-term exposures (e.g. weeks to months) are unclear. Retaining 24C as the maximum is probably a reasonable conservative option in the short term, but simulations assessing sensitivity of cumulative effects predictions to a higher 25.6 C maximum would be informative. ","Based on data from Longnose Dace, supported by data from Nooksack Dace; Empirical data (correlative model); Published; Expert opinion","This function was derived as a composite using a generic curve for Longnose Dace from across North America, and modified based on data for Nooksack Dace from Bertrand Creek and Pepin Creek - Fraser Valley. This includes observational data (catch per unit effort (CPUE) data and associated temperatures at the time minnow traps were lifted; Pearson 2004) and experimental data looking at growth of young-of-year (yoy) dace in experimental enclosures (Gray et al. 2024). As local adaptations are likely minimal among different Nooksack Dace populations. This function should therefore be broadly applicable to all populations of the species, with the caveat that it is partly based on data from other related species","This is largely to be determined, but it will likely be a combination of data from Rosenfeld at al. (2021), data collected by Samantha Ramirez (2024) as part of her M.Sc. thesis, and a database of current and future temperature projections produced by Dr. Iacarella with DFO and collaborators (currently unpublished, but see Weller et al. 2023).",NA,NA,"""Usoof, A.M. and Rosenfeld, J.S. 2024.

Stream temperatures are highly variable within and among watersheds and streams, with maximum temperatures ranging from 10.15°C-39.74°C in the Milk River drainage (usually in August or September; unpublished data). Lethal maximum temperatures in laboratory experiments can get up to 34°C [Schultz and Bertrand 2011]) and experimental agitation temperatures ranged from 9.17°C-31.16°C, though tolerance was influenced by body size (fish were from the Milk River drainage; unpublished data). Therefore, this SR function was derived using a combination of available field and experimental data. Maximum stream temperature was used for this SR function because we had data on upper thermal limits (agitation temperature) for Plains Sucker; however, it should be noted that this temperature SR function could be adjusted to represent the mean annual stream temperature as the independent variable but the stressor magnitude data must be also reported as mean annual stream temperature.
","Based on data from Plains Sucker; Landscape correlation; Unpublished; manipulation; Expert opinion","This stressor-response function is suitable for use on Plains Sucker populations in the Saskatchewan-Nelson and Missouri River drainages in Southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. It should be noted that the thermal tolerance literature tends to assume different populations of the same species have similar physiological thresholds to temperature (Hasnain et al. 2010); however, this assumption hasn’t been specifically studied for Plains Sucker. Similarly, it may be reasonable to assume that the SR function can be applied to Cordilleran Sucker, given the similarity of their physical characteristics (prior to 2023 both species were classified under a single species, Mountain Sucker); however, there is no data to confirm this assumption. Further, Plains Sucker from the Black Hills reportedly have an upper thermal tolerance of 32.9°C-34°C (Schultz and Bertrand 2011), which is within the range reported for other catostomid species (30.7°C-37.2°C, Hasnain et al. 2010). However, given the range of preferred temperatures, caution should be taken when using this function on other catostomids, and it might be more advisable to gauge transferability based on thermal guild (e.g. temperature stressor-response functions for other cool-water species) rather than family. ","Practical application of the SR function necessitates that users obtain estimates of stressor magnitude (level) in the target system. We have data for stream temperature for XX sites within the Milk River drainage; however, these data are not yet published. ",NA,NA,"""Jarvis, L. 2022.

(2021) and Edwards (1983). In addition, we considered the expert opinion provided at the workshop conducted in November 2024.  Maximum system capacity was defined by standardizing data to the highest value for CPUE (fish trap-1). It should be noted that Salish sucker are thought to be somewhat more warm-adapted than Longnose sucker, which are much more widely distributed and considered to be a cool-water species; temperature data for Salish sucker appears to support this inference, since the temperature curve foe Salish sucker appears right-shifted to higher temperatures relative to Longnose sucker. The final curve was derived by fitting a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to original CPUE data from Rosenfeld et al. (2021). The fitted GAM curve was marginally significant (p<0.1) with wide confidence intervals at the high and low temperature extremes, which is likely due to fewer data points at very low and high temperatures. However, we can be fairly confident that the confidence intervals are in fact likely low at very high and low temperatures, despite the wide intervals implied by the GAM.  This is apparent in the narrower confidence intervals in the CPUE-temperature function fit to temperature classes in Rosenfeld et al. (2021; see Fig. 2 below). The lower and upper x-intercepts in the final function (temperature at which system capacity is 0, i.e., 6oC and 23oC respectively) were determined based on the upper and lower temperatures where fish were caught in traps (see supporting SR function Excel file, cells AK157 and AK 171). The habitat suitability index model for Longnose Sucker (Edwards 1983) provided additional supportive evidence for the shape of the function, as did superimposition of Pearson (2004) data on top of the CPUE-temperature SR function. The function was further modified based on input received at the expert workshop i.e. the response to temperature should be a step faction and therefore, the maximum system capacity (100%) should be a plateau rather than a peak. The temperature range of the plateau was chosen as 14 to 18°C (Sierra Sullivan and Mike Pearson, Pers. Comm., 2024).

First, it was assumed there was a 1:1 relationship between the minimum available habitat (bottleneck effect) and the three trout species populations system capacity. To measure habitat, an index presented by Hatfield and Paul (2015) was used which: a) sets all flows >20% Mean Annual Discharge (MAD) to a habitat score of 1 (i.e., maximum suitability); b) has a habitat score of 0 at zero flow (i.e., no suitability); and, c) has a habitat score between 0 and 1 for flows between 0 and 20% MAD using a linear relation. This simple rating curve means that a flow of just under 20% MAD will score close to the maximum of 1, whereas a substantially lower flow will score proportionally less. The index was then used to determine the reduction in habitat scores from water withdrawals. Because withdrawals would have the greatest impact on the habitat score during low flows (i.e., < 20% MAD), percent withdrawal was determined for two periods of the year (August and February) and the lowest 10% of flows (i.e., Q90 or 90% exceedance flow) for these months. The approach was then applied to 37 rivers of varying size in Alberta that had year-round natural or naturalized (i.e., corrected for upstream water use) discharge and percent withdrawals ranging from 0–100% were modelled to assess the decrease in the habitat score from natural. 
For February flow, all 37 rivers showed a similar linear response in the habitat score to water withdrawals. This average response was used as the basis for the stressor-response curve (Figure 1A). For August flows, the rivers showed a highly variable response in the habitat score to water withdrawals, ranging from linear (similar to February) to curvilinear with little initial response but increasing as withdrawals increased. The 75th percentile regression using a general additive model (Koenker 2017) was used to capture the curvilinear relationship (Figure 1B). The overall cumulative effects model only includes the season during which water withdrawals have the greatest effect on bull trout as physical habitat is assumed to limit populations by the minimum and not the combined product of February and August habitat.
As the Joe model accumulates cumulative effects multiplicatively (additive on a proportional scale), treating these two curves separately would inappropriately overemphasize the expected response. To overcome this issue, we treated February and August flow in the Joe model using a limiting factor approach.  Simply, only the strongest, negative response from either the February and August stressor-response curves is used to calculate final system capacity.  Anytime a watershed shows either February or August flow to be a hypothesized key driver, it must be acknowledged that the other stressor could be the driver given the collinearity
","Theoretical relationships; Landscape correlation","This function was applied to the three species for which it was developed (Bull Trout, Athabasca Rainbow Trout, and Westslope Cutthroat Trout). The function correlates environmental flow to habitat quantity through well-studied methods and broad landscape correlation, and thus could be applied to other salmonid species with caution.","The indicator used to measure the stressor in each watershed was the volume of water withdrawal divided by the natural low-flow discharge during February and August (percentage).

Veillard, pers. comm. 22 January 2020). The parasite (Myxobolus cerebralis) can cause high levels of juvenile mortality, and rainbow trout in other jurisdictions have been particularly susceptible (Vincent 1996; Nehring and Walker 1996). No specific studies on the vulnerability of Athabasca Rainbow Trout to whirling disease have been conducted, and it is possible that native stocks of fish are more resistant than hatchery-origin stocks (Baerwald et al. 2011). However, if whirling disease is detected in Athabasca Rainbow Trout streams, it is prudent to manage the effects using information from studies on other strains of Rainbow Trout. 
The stressor-response curve was derived from an Alberta trout age-class cohort model, using variable survival rates on juvenile trout (Sullivan and Spencer 2016).  The population-level effects of whirling disease can be simulated at low, moderate or high levels of risk. This should be qualitatively determined using three factors; the prevalence of whirling disease in the watershed (low, moderate or high), the stream temperature (optimum of 10 0C– 150C mean warmest month = high risk, lower risk at cooler and warmer temperatures), and the gradient of the stream (low risk >4%, moderate risk 2 – 4%, high risk <2% gradient). This follows the Alberta risk assessment concepts for whirling disease (Paul and Reilly 2016). We expect that as Alberta biologists learn more about whirling disease and the key factors that influence its establishment and severity (e.g. Tubifex tubifex density, sediment type, water temperature etc.), and we have the input data to support inclusion within the Joe model, that this stressor-response curve will be refined.","Expert opinion","This function was developed for and applied to Athabasca Rainbow Trout. It was based on lines of evidence from risk assessment models for Alberta trout. Until more data is available to refine the curve, it should be used with caution.","Mainly from studies on trout and char in other jurisdictions, modelled assessments and age-cohort models. No empirical studies on Athabasca Rainbow Trout and whirling disease are currently available (July 2017).  This is a categorical variable, set to none (0) when whirling disease detection is negative (as distinct to “no testing for whirling disease”). The sensitivity of Athabasca Rainbow Trout to whirling disease is influenced by water temperature and water velocity. If whirling disease is detected in the Athabasca drainage, following Paul and Reilly (2016) the risk of whirling disease should be mapped in GIS along the stream network in the Athabasca drainage. For a given watershed, the whirling disease severity was ranked as the mean associated risk for a stream or river in the watershed. Using the mean (rather than the maximum) gives fisheries managers an estimate of the expected whirling disease risk in the overall watershed but does not account for the possibility of local ‘hot spots’ based on temperature or velocity. Disease severity can be adjusted according to local knowledge and updated laboratory results.",NA,NA,"""Government of Alberta. 2024.
